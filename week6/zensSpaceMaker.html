                <h1>Sounds From the Deep of Space</h1>
                <p>Human spaceflight (also referred to as manned spaceflight) is space travel with a
                    crew aboard the spacecraft. When a spacecraft is crewed, it can be operated directly,
                    as opposed to being remotely operated or autonomous.</p>

                <p>The first human spaceflight was launched by the Soviet Union on 12 April 1961 as a part of
                    the Vostok program, with cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin aboard. Humans have been continually present
                    in space for 15 years and 102 days on the International Space Station.</p>

                <p>Since the retirement of the US Space Shuttle in 2011, only Russia and China have maintained
                    human spaceflight capability with the Soyuz program and Shenzhou program. Currently, all
                    expeditions to the International Space Station use Soyuz vehicles, which remain attached to
                    the station to allow quick return if needed. The United States is developing commercial crew
                    transportation to facilitate domestic access to ISS and low Earth orbit, as well as the Orion
                    vehicle for beyond-low Earth orbit applications.</p>

        	<p>US President John F. Kennedy raised the stakes of the Space Race by setting the goal of landing a man on
                the Moon and returning him safely by the end of the 1960s.[3] The US started the three-man Apollo
                program in 1961 to accomplish this, launched by the Saturn family of launch vehicles, and the interim
                two-man Project Gemini in 1962, which flew 10 missions launched by Titan II rockets in 1965 and 1966.
                Gemini's objective was to support Apollo by developing American orbital spaceflight experience and
                techniques to be used in the Moon mission.</p>

            <p>Meanwhile, the USSR remained silent about their intentions to send humans to the Moon, and proceeded
            to stretch the limits of their single-pilot Vostok capsule into a two- or three-person Voskhod capsule to
            compete with Gemini. They were able to launch two orbital flights in 1964 and 1965 and achieved the first
            spacewalk, made by Alexei Leonov on Voskhod 2 on March 8, 1965. But Voskhod did not have Gemini's capability
            to maneuver in orbit, and the program was terminated. The US Gemini flights did not accomplish the first
            spacewalk, but overcame the early Soviet lead by performing several spacewalks and solving the problem of
            astronaut fatigue caused by overcoming the lack of gravity, demonstrating up to two weeks endurance in a
            human spaceflight, and the first space rendezvous and dockings of spacecraft.</p>
