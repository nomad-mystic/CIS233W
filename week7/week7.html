                        The International Space Station (ISS) is a space station, or a habitable artificial satellite,
                        in low Earth orbit. Its first component launched into orbit in 1998, and the ISS is now the
                        largest artificial body in orbit and can often be seen with the naked eye from Earth. The
                        ISS consists of pressurised modules, external trusses, solar arrays, and other components.
                        ISS components have been launched by Russian Proton and Soyuz rockets as well as American
                        Space Shuttles.

                <h3>Scientific Research</h3>

                    <p>
                        The ISS provides a platform to conduct scientific research. Small unmanned
                        spacecraft can provide platforms for zero gravity and exposure to space, but
                        space stations offer a long term environment where studies can be performed
                        potentially for decades, combined with ready access by human researchers over
                        periods that exceed the capabilities of manned spacecraft.

                <h3>Exploration</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        The ISS provides a location in the relative safety of Low Earth Orbit to test
                        spacecraft systems that will be required for long-duration missions to the Moon
                        and Mars. This provides experience in operations, maintenance as well as repair
                        and replacement activities on-orbit, which will be essential skills in operating
                        spacecraft farther from Earth, mission risks can be reduced and the capabilities of
                        interplanetary spacecraft advanced. Referring to the MARS-500 experiment, ESA states that
                        "Whereas the ISS is essential for answering questions concerning the possible impact of
                        weightlessness, radiation and other space-specific factors, aspects such as the effect of
                        long-term isolation and confinement can be more appropriately addressed via ground-based
                        simulations". Sergey Krasnov, the head of human space flight programmes for Russia's
                        space agency, Roscosmos, in 2011 suggested a "shorter version" of MARS-500 may be carried
                        out on the ISS.

                <h3>Education and Cultural Outreach</h3>

                    <p>
                        The ISS crew provides opportunities for students on Earth by running
                        student-developed experiments, making educational demonstrations, allowing
                        for student participation in classroom versions of ISS experiments, and
                        directly engaging students using radio, videolink and email. ESA
                        offers a wide range of free teaching materials that can be downloaded for
                        use in classrooms. In one lesson, students can navigate a 3-D model of
                        the interior and exterior of the ISS, and face spontaneous challenges to solve
                        in real time.
